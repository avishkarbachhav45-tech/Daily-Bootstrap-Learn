### - Day 3 : Badges
Documentation and examples for badges, our small count and labeling component.


### - Day 4 : Alerts
Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.


### - Day 5 : Cards
Bootstrap’s cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options.


### - Day 6 : Images
Documentation and examples for opting images into responsive behavior (so they never become wider than their parent) and add lightweight styles to them—all via classes.


### - Day 7 : Tables
Documentation and examples for opt-in styling of tables (given their prevalent use in JavaScript plugins) with Bootstrap.
